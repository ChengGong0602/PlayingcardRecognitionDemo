-If the resolution of the card is not clear, execute "CardRecog_with_newStudy_1.cmd"
  If the resolution of the card is clear, execute "CardRecog_with_newStudy_2.cmd"
-If you want to test in Real time with GPU, execute "CardRecog_Realtime with GPU_1.cmd","CardRecog_Realtime with GPU_2.cmd"
-If you want to test in Real time with only CPU, execute "CardRecog_Realtime with only CPU_1.cmd",''CardRecog_Realtime with only CPU_2.cmd''

**Remember:
Test with GPU will faster 50 times than testing with cpu.
Test with CPU will perform very slowly(one frame card every 5 seconds).
